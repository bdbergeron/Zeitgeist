# Zeitgeist
> 👁 An iOS and iPadOS app for keeping an eye on your Vercel deployments

Welcome to the Zeitgeist repository! Zeitgeist is an iOS and iPadOS client for browsing your [Vercel](https://vercel.com) projects and deployments. It’s built using SwiftUI and takes advantage of the iOS 15 and 16 SDKs to offer:

- Real-time updates via background push notifications
- Refreshable views
- Server-side filtering of deployments
- Lock Screen and Home Screen widgets

## Development
I have a full-time job and a young child, so development of Zeitgeist can sometimes be slow! If you're interested in contributing, the best way to help me out is by opening issues detailing any bugs you encounter or features you'd like to see added to the app.
